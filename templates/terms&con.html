                <p>Investing in cryptocurrency mining involves a high degree of risk and should only be undertaken by individuals who fully understand the risks involved. Before investing in cryptocurrency mining, please read the following terms and conditions carefully:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Investment Risks: </b>The investment in cryptocurrency mining is highly speculative and involves significant risks. The value of cryptocurrencies can be extremely volatile and may fluctuate widely due to factors beyond the control of the miner or investor. The profitability of mining cryptocurrency can also be affected by various factors such as changes in mining difficulty, market demand, and regulatory changes.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>No Guarantee of Profit:</b> There is no guarantee that the mining operation will be profitable, and investors should not rely on any representations made by the miner regarding potential returns on investment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Limited Liquidity:</b> Cryptocurrencies, including those mined, may have limited liquidity and may be subject to significant price volatility. The ability to sell or trade mined cryptocurrencies may be limited or may require the payment of significant fees.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Regulatory Risks:</b> The mining of cryptocurrencies is subject to various regulatory risks, including changes to laws and regulations governing cryptocurrency mining and taxation. These risks may have a negative impact on the profitability of the mining operation.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Technical Risks:</b> Mining cryptocurrency requires specialized hardware and software, and there is a risk that such hardware and software may not operate as intended, resulting in decreased profitability or even complete loss of investment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>No Warranty:</b> The miner provides no warranty or guarantee that the mining operation will be uninterrupted or error-free. The miner disclaims all liability for any damages arising out of or related to the mining operation, including but not limited to lost profits, loss of data, or any other consequential or incidental damages.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Investment Restrictions:</b> The miner may impose investment restrictions, such as minimum investment amounts or limits on the number of investors, and may change these restrictions at any time without prior notice.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Disclosure:</b> The miner will provide investors with regular updates on the mining operation, including updates on profitability, costs, and any other relevant information. Investors should carefully review all such information and disclosures and should seek independent advice if necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Termination:</b> The miner may terminate the mining operation at any time, without prior notice, and may require investors to withdraw their investment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Governing Law:</b> This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the miner is located.
                    <br><br>
                    By investing in cryptocurrency mining, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the risks associated with such investment and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth above. You also acknowledge that you are investing at your own risk and that you are solely responsible for any losses that may result from such investment.</p>
